## Project 2 : Restaurant Ratings Application

New Yorkers love to eat out. Part of the dining experience is ensuring that
your destination has the highest health and safety standards. I am going to
create a simple application that will allow New Yorkers to search
for restaurants and their respective inspection grades (these grades are
carried out on a scale from A to C, A being the highest and most desirable
while C indicates a lesser standard).

I am going to utilize the New York City Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene's Restaurant Inspection Results API for this application.

## Component Hierarchy


## What problems will I encounter?
I think that the difficulty will be ensuring that the different components
function smoothly. For example, the user will arrive to the welcome page. There,
they will click a button that directs them to the form page, where they can
search for a restaurant and get its rating and other details.

I also think that I will need to ensure that it's styled well, as this will
improve the user experience. When making an application, it's important for it
to be both functional and presentable.

## How will I solve these problems?
Regarding the styling of the application, I will do some research and look at
how other applications are styled. I want to make sure both my form component
and the restaurant information component are easy-to-read and look good.

## MVP
By the end of the week, I hope to have an application with the following:

+ A landing page with a button (which links to a search form)
+ A search form that allows the user to look up their restaurant by name
+ A Restaurant detail page that displays the restaurant name, the type of
cuisine, the letter grade it received, and the date of inspection/the date
the grade was awarded

## Post-MVP
After I achieve my MVP, I hope to add the following to my application:

+ A more complex form page where the user can look up restaurant inspection
results by borough or zipcode
+ I want to add a map that displays the specified restaurant's location
(which would require Google Maps API)
